    <h1 style="font-family: Sans-serif;padding-left:20px;color:#4d4d4d;">Margin Metrics Dashboard</h1>
    <ul style="font-family: Sans-serif;font-size: 20px;color:#4d4d4d;">
        <li>With the implementation of this dashboard, we show the margin metrics, happy customer metrics and customer
            acquisition cost metrics of Alyce Database.</li><br>
        <li>This contains overall sales analysis of Alyce client’s across months
            by considering net margin & gross margin.</li><br>
        <li>The most important metrics to track about the business are margins.
            Margins measure profitability and are calculated by comparing profits to the revenue. Typically, Margins are
            measured as a percent of revenue and is represented in dashboards to judge the profitability of the
            business.</li><br>
        <li>We
            can show total clients and their contributions in our revenue by displaying geographical map spread across
            United States.</li><br>

        <li>The CAC metric is important to two parties: companies and investors. The first party includes outside, early
            stage investors who use it to analyze the scalability of new Internet technology companies. They can
            determine a
            company’s profitability by looking at the difference between how much money can be extracted from customers
            and
            the costs of extracting it.</li><br>
        <li>This metric is shown in the dashboard along with the sales revenue to determine
            Alyce’s profitability. Customer lifetime value (or life-time value (LTV), is the average amount of money
            your
            customers will spend on your business over the entire life of your relationship.</li><br>
        <li> The customer lifetime value
            is
            shown in the historical approach by the total value of each transaction multiplied by Alyce average gross
            margin..</li><br>
